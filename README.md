Welcome to the Build‐it‐yourself CMD FD‐Series support github site

It is here where you're going to find the information you need to complete the build of your reproduction CMD FD-Series Drive.

This is a moderate difficulty build. Experience soldering and debugging issues is something that you'll be taking on for yourself. If this seems too daunting, then perhaps get a friend with those skills to solder it up for you and do the preliminary testing.

With respect to the case, there are two designs available. The first is a 3D printable version of the case. This case is print compatible with FDM style printers as well as resin printers. You may order the FDM 3D printed case directly from PCBWay or through COREi64.com. Resin printing of the 3D printable case is available from PCBWay Shared Projects exclusively. The second case style that will be available is a reproduction of the original metal case. This case is also be available for order through PCBWay Shared Projects.

This github will evolve as more information becomes available or is requested.
